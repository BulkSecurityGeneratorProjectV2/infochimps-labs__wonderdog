<h2>Getting Started with ElasticSearch</h2>

<pre class="brush: bash">
$: wget http://github.com/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.14.2.zip
$: sudo mv elasticsearch-0.14.2 /usr/local/share/
$: sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/elasticsearch-0.14.2 /usr/local/share/elasticsearch
</pre>

Next you'll want to make sure there is an 'elasticsearch' user and that there are suitable data, work, and log directories that 'elasticsearch' owns:

<pre class="brush: bash">
$: sudo useradd elasticsearch
$: sudo mkdir -p /var/log/elasticsearch /var/run/elasticsearch/{data,work}
$: sudo chown -R elasticsearch /var/{log,run}/elasticsearch
</pre>

Go ahead and copy the example configuration:

<pre class="brush: bash">
$: sudo mkdir -p /etc/elasticsearch
$: sudo cp config/elasticsearch-example.yml /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
$: sudo cp config/logging.yml /etc/elasticsearch/
$: sudo cp config/elasticsearch.in.sh /etc/elasticsearch/
</pre>

and make changes to 'elasticsearch.yml' such that it points to the correct data, work, and log directories. Also, you'll want to change the number of 'recovery_after_nodes' and 'expected_nodes' in elasticsearch.yml to however many nodes (machines) you actually expect to have in your cluster. You'll probably also want to do a quick once-over of elasticsearch.in.sh and make sure the jvm settings, etc are sane for your particular setup. Finally, to startup do:

<pre class="brush: bash">
sudo -u elasticsearch /usr/local/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch -Des.config=/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
</pre>

You should now have a happily running (reasonably configured) elasticsearch data node.
