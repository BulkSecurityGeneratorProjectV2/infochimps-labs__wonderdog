<h2>Install and start ElasticSearch</h2>

<pre class="brush: bash">
$: wget http://github.com/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.14.2.zip
$: sudo mv elasticsearch-0.14.2 /usr/local/share/
$: sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/elasticsearch-0.14.2 /usr/local/share/elasticsearch
$: /usr/local/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch
</pre>

You'll probably want to change the configuration for your particular setup but that should at least get you started.
